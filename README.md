# P5.JS Boilerplate

## Description

A minimal, simple-to-use boilerplate for quick creation of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) projects.\
It's designed so it only uses a simple .js boilerplate creation file and **node.js**

## What does it make?

When you run the [boilerplate.js](boilerplate.js), it:

1. Creates the project's main folder
2. Creates a base HTML file with links to [hosted version of the p5.js library](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.9.0/lib/p5.js) and to the main .js file created in step 3
3. Creates a main JavaScript file with the same name as the project
4. Creates an assets folder for storing all sorts of assets

## How to use it?

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if you haven't already
2. [Download](https://github.com/bsplt/p5js-boilerplate/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repository or clone it with:\
   `git clone https://github.com/yuri-mascarenhas/p5js-boilerplate.git`
3. Run it with node:\
   `node boilerplate.js <project-title>`

Note that the project folder will be created **relative** to the repository folder. If you want to create in an **absolute** path you should pass the complete directory path.

## Frameworks

- [p5.js v1.9.0](<(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.9.0/lib/p5.js)>)
